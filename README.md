# Mad Libs Game
================

A word game where the user has to fill in the blanks with words to create a funny story.

## Description

This project aims to create a Mad Libs game in Python, following a structured workflow to ensure a well-documented and maintainable codebase.

## Features

### MVP Version

* Story Template: A pre-defined story template with blank spaces for words.
* Word Input: A user interface to input words (e.g., noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to fill in the blank spaces.
* Story Generation: A function to generate the completed story by replacing the blank spaces with the user-inputted words.
* Story Display: A way to display the generated story to the user.
* Validation and Error Handling: The code includes input validation and error handling to ensure the user enters words in the correct format and to handle any errors that may occur.

### Implemented Features

* Story Themes: The game now includes multiple story themes, allowing the user to choose from different story templates.
* Word Categories: The game now includes word categories (e.g., noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to guide the user's input.
* Input Validation: The game includes basic input validation to ensure the user enters words in the correct format.

### To-Do

The following features are planned for incremental improvements:

#### Easiest (1-3 days of development)

* Word Suggestions: Provide word suggestions or hints to help users who are stuck.
* Story Customization: Allow users to customize the story template by adding or removing blank spaces.
* User Profiles: Implement user profiles to save and load previous stories.

#### Moderate (3-7 days of development)

* AI-powered Word Suggestions: Integrate AI-powered word suggestions based on the user's input and story context.
* Multi-player Mode: Develop a multi-player mode where users can play together, taking turns to input words.
* Story Analytics: Implement analytics to track user behavior, story popularity, and word usage.

#### Hardest (7+ days of development)

* Advanced Story Generation: Implement advanced story generation techniques, such as using machine learning algorithms to generate stories based on user input.
* Story Sharing: Allow users to share their generated stories on social media or via email.

## Getting Started

To run the game, simply execute the `mad_libs.py` file using Python.
