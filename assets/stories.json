            "His dark hair was mussed, and his leather jacket was scarred and worn from countless close calls.",
            "As a former Corpo agent, Ramael had thought he'd seen it all.",
            "But after his boss got flatlined, he found himself on the streets, struggling to make ends meet.",
            "Merc work was a living, but it wasn't a good one.",
            "Ramael's income was constantly being drained by repair bills for the havoc he wreaked on the city's infrastructure, which he often had to escape from in his trusty ___.",
            "Just as he was starting to think he'd never find a job, a message flashed on his comms device.",

            "The Red Vixen was a dive bar on the wrong side of town, the kind of place where only the desperate and the depraved hung out.",
            "But Ramael was desperate, so he made his way to the bar, his hand resting on the grip of his pistol, as he listened to the sounds of ___ music drifting from inside.",
            "As he pushed open the door, a wave of smoke and noise washed over him.",
            "The Red Vixen was a pit, but it was also a hub of information.",
            "Ramael spotted his contact, a hooded figure sipping on a whiskey, and made his way over.",
            "\"You're the one they call Ramael, right?\"",

            "The Oni-Kiru tower was a fortress, a high-security facility that was rumored to be impenetrable.",
            "But the pay was too good to pass up, and Ramael was desperate.",
            "\"I'm in,\" he said, extending a hand.",
            "The hooded figure smiled, and handed Ramael a data pad with the job details.",
            "Ramael's eyes scanned the pad, his mind racing with the possibilities.",
            "This was going to be a long night, and he would have to navigate through the crowded streets of the city, avoiding the ___ that seemed to be everywhere.",
            "He would have to be careful, as the city was full of ___."
