                        "His dark hair was mussed, and his leather jacket was scarred and worn from countless close calls.",
                        "As a former Corpo agent, Ramael had thought he'd seen it all.",
                        "But after his boss got flatlined, he found himself on the streets, struggling to make ends meet.",
                        "Merc work was a living, but it wasn't a good one.",
                        "Ramael's income was constantly being drained by repair bills for the havoc he wreaked on the city's infrastructure, which he often had to escape from in his trusty ___.",

                        "But Ramael was desperate, so he made his way to the bar, his hand resting on the grip of his pistol, as he listened to the sounds of ___ music drifting from inside.",
                        "As he pushed open the door, a wave of smoke and noise washed over him.",
                        "The Red Vixen was a pit, but it was also a hub of information.",
                        "Ramael spotted his contact, a hooded figure sipping on a whiskey, and made his way over.",
